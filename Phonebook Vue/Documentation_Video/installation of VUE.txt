This is my first time using Vue:

I first  researched and found out that the React,Vue, Angular are there on libaries.
these can run app and are similar to Html and css and how we create databases, however there are a few steps 
that i had to take in order to get it started up.


The first step was install the Vue package on my PC:
- CMD to install Vue: npm install -g @vue/cli

- created the project vue create project-name
- open the project 
- start the server for development  
using npm run serve
-  gives the IP  http://localhost:8080/

- which then gives you the Vue main page and Documentation
The new step was to code the App which i had to the use VS code 
where i got the path where i created my project which was 
under local disk C:\Users\kylen\project-name

- open VS code 
- open folder 
- find the project 


once that is done i had access to mutiple files
here i coded in the SRC/App.vue 
where i could create and edit and run code.


npm run serve this gave the IP that opened a App i coded


Then to get a database i used the Json server 
- npm install -g json-server which i run the the terminal in VS code shortcut 
crtl + `
- once that is done it gave anoter IP http://localhost:3000
- run   the database npx json-server --watch db.json

then i was all set up  

i have these pages App.vue , main.js,script.js,style.css and the db.json

App.vue  contains the main Html structure of the web app 
main.js  contains libraries and elemenst for the App.vue
script.js contains all the functions to get data and display , filter it to the web page.
style.css contains all the styling for the web app 
db.json this is the database that contains 2 arrays entries(http://localhost:3000/entries) and phonebooks(http://localhost:3000/phonebooks)

How the app works the Phonebook page allows user to search for a phonebook then user can click the bullpoint and it will open 
the details of teh entries in that phonebook

the add entries user can select the phonebook that they want to store the entries then enter the name and number of the user
the add phonebook users just need to enter the phone book name
